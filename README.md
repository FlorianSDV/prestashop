## ⚠️ Preface️ ⚠️

This is the `beta` branch, which contains the source code of the upcoming MyParcel PrestaShop v2.0.0 release. We've rewritten the entire module from scratch, using the [MyParcel Plugin Development Kit]. This module supports PrestaShop 8 and Php 7.4 through 8.2 (and onwards). See the [pinned issue] for more information on the changes.

> To view the readme and source code of the current stable version (v1.x) of the module, please switch to the [`main` branch](https://github.com/myparcelnl/prestashop/tree/main).

For a less bug-prone experience, we recommend you use the stable or release candidate versions of the module instead. You can find the stable and release candidates in the [releases] section of this repository. The release candidates are versioned with a `-rc` suffix.

If you do choose to install this version, we would love to hear your feedback. Please report any issues you encounter using the [Bug report for v2.0.0-beta.x form] or by sending an email to [support@myparcel.nl]. Use in production is at your own risk.

## Introduction

This module allows you to seamlessly integrate [the MyParcel services] into your PrestaShop webshop.

## Requirements
