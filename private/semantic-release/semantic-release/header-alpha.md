## ðŸš§ This version is not ready for production use ðŸš§

This is the latest alpha release of MyParcel PrestaShop v2.x. We've rewritten the entire module from scratch, using the [MyParcel Plugin Development Kit]. This module supports PrestaShop 8 and Php 7.4 through 8.2 (and onwards).

For a safer experience, we recommend you to use the stable or release candidate version of the plugin. You can find the stable and release candidates in the [releases] section of this repository. The release candidates are versioned with a `-rc` suffix.

If you do choose to install this version, we would love to hear your feedback. Please report any issues you encounter using the [Bug report for v2.0.0-alpha.x form] or by sending an email to [support@myparcel.nl]
