## âš  Warning âš 

ðŸš§ This version is **not ready for production use**. ðŸš§

This is the alpha release of the next major version of the MyParcel PrestaShop plugin. We've rewritten the plugin from scratch, using the [MyParcel Plugin Development Kit]. This version supports PHP 8 and PrestaShop 8.

For a safer experience, we recommend you to use the stable or release candidate version of the plugin. You can find the stable and release candidates in the [releases] section of this repository. The release candidates are versioned with a `-rc` suffix.

If you do choose to install this version, we would love to hear your feedback. Please report any issues you encounter using the [Bug report for v2.0.0-alpha.x form] or by sending an email to [support@myparcel.nl]
